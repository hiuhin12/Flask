# Optimizing Inventory Management through Product Classification with K-MEANS, K-MEANS++, and K-MEDOIDS ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

## Introduction
This project analyzes and optimizes inventory management using machine learning clustering algorithms such as K-Means, K-Means++, and K-Medoids. The goal is to improve inventory turnover and reduce excess stock through data-driven insights.

## Contents

1. **Source Code**
   - **Python**: The source code for data analysis and machine learning models is implemented in Python. This includes notebooks and scripts for data preprocessing, clustering algorithms (K-Means, K-Means++, K-Medoids), and visualization.
     - **Files:**
       - `Fullcode.ipynb`: Contains the complete Python code for exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, determining the optimal number of clusters, standard K-Means clustering, K-Means++ clustering, K-Medoids clustering, and evaluating the clustering performance.
    
2. **Power BI Files**
   - `Product_dashboard.pbix`: This dashboard displays stock quantity over time and analyzes inventory levels by product category.
   - `Sale_dashboard.pbix`: This dashboard focuses on analyzing sales quantity and total cost, as well as sales quantity by product category.
   - `Kmeans_plus_insight_dashboard.pbix`: This dashboard provides insights from K-Means++ clustering, including analysis of product clusters based on sales quantity, stock quantity, and total cost.
       
3. **Report Files**
   - **Files:** `235MI7101_Group6_FinalProject.docx`, `235MI7101_Group6_FinalProject.pdf`
   - **Description:** The study utilizes K-Means, K-Means++, and K-Medoids clustering algorithms to classify products, aiming to enhance inventory management. By analyzing data from e-commerce platforms, the research demonstrates that clustering can reduce holding costs, prevent overstocking, and improve decision-making processes in inventory controlâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹.

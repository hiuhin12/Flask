# Optimizing Inventory Management through Product Classification with K-MEANS, K-MEANS++, and K-MEDOIDS ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and optimize inventory management using machine learning clustering algorithms. The following sections provide an overview of the documents and files included in the project.

## Contents

1. **Source Code**
   - **Python**: The source code for data analysis and machine learning models is implemented in Python. This includes notebooks and scripts for data preprocessing, clustering algorithms (K-Means, K-Means++, K-Medoids), and visualization.
     - **Files:**
       - `eda.ipynb`: Contains exploratory data analysis code.
       - `k.ipynb`: Contains code for determining the optimal number of clusters.
       - `kmeans.ipynb`: Python code for standard K-Means clustering algorithm.
       - `kmeans++.ipynb`: Contains Python code for K-Means++ clustering algorithm.
       - `K-Medoids.ipynb`: Python code for K-Medoids clustering algorithm.
       - `evaluate.ipynb`: Code for evaluating the clustering performance.
    
2. **Power BI Files**
   - **Files:**
     - `stock_product_category.pbix`: Contains data visualization dashboards used to analyze the inventory data.
     - `sale.pbix`: Power BI file for sales data analysis.
     - `kmeans++ insight.pbix`: Power BI file for insights derived from the K-Means++ clustering analysis.

3. **Turnitin Checked File**
   - **File:** `sá»­a.pdf`
   - **Description:** The report checked for similarity using Turnitin. The similarity index is under 30%, and no AI writing is detected.

4. **Report Files**
   - **Files:** `sá»­a.docx`, `sá»­a.pdf`
   - **Description:** The final report in Word and PDF formats after rewriting based on Turnitin checking. The report includes a page of responsibilities, the percentage of contributions, and the score of each member. The team leader has discussed these elements with the teammates.

5. **Datasets**
   - **Files:**
     - `final_data_sale_stock_cost.xlsx`
       - **Description:** Contains sales, stock, and cost data.
     - `cleaned_data.csv`
       - **Description:** Preprocessed and cleaned dataset for analysis.
